The code MPSsimulateGM.m computes statistics in Table 7, panels II and III.  The current specification produces the endogenous s and theta case for panel II.  To compute the HM specification, simply change the gama and totalb to the HM value written in the code.  To compute the DMP model case, simply set selas to 0 in the code.  

To calculate the panel III of Appendix Table C3, simply change the values of alpha and psi for "counterfactual case" value specified in the code.
