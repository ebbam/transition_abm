\begin{document}

The model's central functionality relies on a variety of behavioural
mechanisms that are parametrised econometrically using micro data.
Furthermore, the model relies on additional sources of micro data for
validation. In the following section we outline, first, the data and
analysis used to derive the model's behavioral parameters, followed by
an inventory of the data used to validate various model outputs. We note
where we make use of methodology employed or constructed by other
authors. We conclude with an inventory of other data sources considered
for behavioral parameter calibration ultimately disregarded due to lack
of statistical power.

\subsection{Application Effort and Learning Dynamics: Applications
Sent}\label{application-effort-and-learning-dynamics-applications-sent}

In 2018 (May, September) and 2020 (February, May), the Bureau of Labor
Statistics ran the ``Unemployment Insurance Nonfilers'' supplemental
survey to the monthly Current Population Survey run by the US Census
Bureau. The survey's stated intent was to ``obtain information on the
characteristics of people who do not file for Unemployment Insurance
benefits as well as their reasons for not doing so.'' The survey was
conducted for all person responding the the monthly Current Population
Survey which encompasses ``all persons in the civilian non-institutional
population of the United States living in households. The probability
sample selected to represent the universe consists of approximately
54,000 households.''

This 2020
\href{https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-9/how-do-jobseekers-search-for-jobs.htm\#_edn5}{``Beyond
the Numbers'' issue} distills insights from a 2018 Supplement to the
Current Population Survey. The below plots show the highlights relevant
to our decision-making on the job search process.

In nearly all cases, the results are ``binned'' into intervals (ie.
number of people sending 81 or more applications or unemployment
duration of between 5 and 14 weeks) which means that any line plots (or
linear interpretation of the bar graph) should be done carefully. We
employ the raw data informing thsee figures. The description of our
analysis of the raw data is found in the next section.

In Figure 1, the top left panel shows the proportion of all individuals
sending X amount of applications receiving Y amount of interviews. The
plot indicates a ``consistent'' return to sending more applications,
although as demonstrated in the bottom left plot, the number of
applications sent is not a linear predictor of job offers received. More
precisely, the bottom left plot demonstrates that the percentage of
jobseekers receiving an offer seems to increase as a function of the
number of applications sent, until a certain point.Next, the right plot
demonstrates the number of applications sent (red), interviews received
(green), average interview:application ratio (blue), and probability of
receiving a job offer (purple) by individuals in each category of
unemployment duration. There is some indication that both effort and
success seem to increase and then decline with time spent in
unemployment, apart from success as measured by receiving a job offer
which seems to consistently decline with time spent in unemployment.

\caption{Replication of BLS Analysis}
\end{figure}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{behav_params_overview_files/figure-latex/cps_supp2-1.png}}

Below, we display the results of an exploration of the probability of
reporting a specific number of applications sent (in the bins as in the
survey question above) using various specifications of an ordinal
logistic regression. I test specifications varying three different model
parameters:\\
1. link function\\
2. linear vs.~quadratic unemploymentduration,\\
3. with and without demographic control variables (education, gender,
age, family income - race excluded because of lack of statistical
significance though this can be revisited.)

We estimate an ordinal logistic regression model for reported
applications sent \(Y_i\) in \({0, 1, 2, 3, 4}\) testing four different
link functions: the complementary log-log (cloglog), logistic, log-log,
and probit link functions. Let \(X_i^\top \beta\) denote the predictor
variable. The cumulative probability of observing response category
\(j\) or below, \(\Pr(Y_i \leq j \mid X_i)\), is modeled as follows for
each link function:

\begin{align*}
\text{Complementary log-log (cloglog):} \quad & \Pr(Y_i \leq j \mid X_i) = 1 - \exp\left( -\exp\left( \tau_j - X_i^\top \beta \right) \right) \\
\text{Logistic (logit):} \quad & \Pr(Y_i \leq j \mid X_i) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left( -(\tau_j - X_i^\top \beta) \right)} \\
\text{Loglog:} \quad & \Pr(Y_i \leq j \mid X_i) = \exp\left( -\exp\left( -(\tau_j - X_i^\top \beta) \right) \right) \\
\text{Probit:} \quad & \Pr(Y_i \leq j \mid X_i) = \Phi(\tau_j - X_i^\top \beta)
\end{align*}

Here, \(\Phi(\cdot)\) denotes the cumulative distribution function of
the standard normal distribution. The estimated coefficients \(\beta\)
are interpreted conditional on the choice of link function where \(X_i\)
is either:

\(X_i = \left( \text{Unemp.Dur.}_i \right)\)

\(X_i = \left( \text{Unemp.Dur.}_i^2 \right)\)

\(X_i = \left( \text{Unemp.Dur.}_i, \text{Unemp.Dur.}_i^2 \right)\)

with and without control variables (education, gender, age, family
income).

Assumptions about the probability distribution of the errors associated
with each link function:\\
- \emph{Logit:} Useful when responses are evenly distributed across
categories.\\
- \emph{Probit:} Useful when latent variable is assumed to be normally
distributed.\\
- \emph{Complementary log-log:} Useful when higher categories are more
probable.\\
- \emph{Log-log:} When early categories are of more importance or more
probable.

\emph{Preliminary hypothesis:} Best fit will be with a complementary
log-log as we care more about distinguishing between lower-level bins
and there are few observations in the highest-level bins.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{behav_params_overview_files/figure-latex/cps_supp3-1.png}}
\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{behav_params_overview_files/figure-latex/cps_supp3-2.png}}
\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{behav_params_overview_files/figure-latex/cps_supp3-3.png}}

Using an AIC information criterion to compare the fit across all models,
the following results are clear:\\
1. Models with control variables consistently perform better than those
without.\\
2. Looking at the plots above, the relationship between unemployment
duration and the predicted probability of reporting each application
effort bin is very consistent except in the case of the log-log link
function (blue in the panels above). In the plot below comparing the AIC
the log-log link function (represented by the square symbol below) is
consistently worse than all other link functions. This indicates
consistency in the results reported above. Intuitively, the log-log link
function is likely to be an unreasonable fit for the latent variable as
we care more about shifts in the lower-level categories than
higher-level categories.\\
3. A complementary log-log specification for the latent variable is most
suitable. This follows logically from the fact that the probability of
being in the highest-level categories is relatively low.\\
4. Finally, a specification with a linear and quadratic estimator is
consistently better than either the specification with simply a linear
OR quadratic unemployment duration estimator indicating that the
probability distributions represented in the final panel above are
likely to be the best fit.

\emph{Result:} For each additional quarter of unemployment, an
individual's odds of dropping to a lower-level application category
decreases by \textasciitilde.1\%. This is statistically significant
across all specifications at the 0.1\% level.

\subsection{Wage Expectations and Satisficing: Reservation Wage
Adjustment}\label{wage-expectations-and-satisficing-reservation-wage-adjustment}

As part of the Current Population Survey, the US Census Bureau conducts
an annual Displaced Worker Supplement in which workers who have lost
their job in the last three years are asked additional questions about
their unemployment experiences and (if re-employed) their re-employment
conditions. From this we draw a reservation wage adjustment rate as a
function of unemployment duration. We compare various econometric
specifications across several samples that correct for selection effects
that typically confound studies of duration-dependent employment
outcomes.

As part of the Current Population Survey, the US Census Bureau conducts
an annual
\href{https://cps.ipums.org/cps/dw_sample_notes.shtml}{Displaced Worker
Supplement} in which workers who have lost their job in the last three
years are asked additional questions about their unemployment
experiences and (if re-employed) their re-employment conditions.

As reported in the survey documentation linked above, ``the universe for
the Displaced Workers Supplement is civilians 20 or older. Respondents
are further categorized as a `displaced worker' if they meet additional
characteristics (see DWSTAT). Users should note that there is an
important difference in definition of displaced worker across samples.
Before 1994, displaced workers are those who lost or left a job during
the past 5 years. After 1994, displaced workers are those who lost or
left a job due to layoffs or shutdowns within the past 3 years.
\textbf{For 1998 on, respondents are only considered displaced workers
if they had lost or left a job due to layoffs or shutdowns within the
past 3 years, were not self-employed, and did not expect to be recalled
to work within the next six months. Self-response was not required for
this supplement after 1994, so often one individual answered for all
household members.}''

We utilize the information reported on an individual's weekly wage at
their lost job, wage at their new job, and the time spent unemployed to
derive a measure of duration-dependent reservation wage adjustment. More
precisely, we regress the ratio of the new wage to the wage at the lost
job on unemployment duration and various control variables in a
cross-sectional setting. We compare the model fit across linear,
quadratic, and cubic specificaitions, with and without various
combinations of control variables (whether or not an individual received
unemployment compensation, age, race, sex, marital status, education,
previous wage level). Note that wages are reported in hourly and weekly
values but this reporting is inconsistent across observations. In other
words, though most individuals (4600/6198) report their wage in both
units, 270 report only hourly and 1328 report only weekly. We reconcile
this by converting reported hourly wages to weekly wages, where weekly
values are not reported. The data used below is from annual survey
responses between 2000-2025. We use the supplement sample weights in all
results below. In the We note where the sample has been trimmed for
outliers (wage ratio between {[}0.25, 2{]} and unemployment duration
less than 96 weeks (\textasciitilde24 months).

Below, we outline the data cleaning procedure, provide descriptive
figures and statistics, outline the econometric estimation strategy,
provide regression results using the raw sample and reweighted samples
addressing selection issues and non-uniformity, and provide information
on the representativeness of the raw sample. The sample is non-uniform
in unemployment duration (less observations are observed for higher
values of unemployment duration). We employ three methods of reweighting
to address these selection issues (Heckman Selection correction,
entropy-balancing, and propensity score matching) to deal with
representativeness issues of across values of unemployment durations.
These re-weighting and sample balancing methods confirm the
directionality of the regression results in the non-uniform sample,
providing greater confidence in the triangulated reservation wage
adjustment rate.

Overall, we find that individuals accept a \textasciitilde1-percentage
point decrease in the wage ratio per additional month of unemployment.
Variations using model reweighting, different samples, combinations of
control variables, reported hourly and weekly wage ratios do not seem to
affect the result. However, the data seems to follow a non-linear
relationship (we see little satisficing until around \textasciitilde12
months of unemployment) after which the wage ratio begins to decrease.
Individuals seem to accept a below-1 relative wage ratio (current
wage:wage at lost job) following a year of unemployment.

\textbf{Potential Limitations:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Displaced worker classification as outlined above.} We do not
  distinguish between workers in our model that are voluntarily or
  involuntarily separated from their jobs. Therefore, the displaced
  worker classification outlined above does not represent individuals
  unemployed voluntarily.
\item
  \textbf{The reported `current wage' is not necessarily the realised
  wage post-re-employment.} Individuals report the wage at their lost
  job, the amount of time unemployed until they were re-employed, and
  the wage they hold at their current job. However, it is not indicated
  whether the current job is the same job as the first they were
  re-employed at. As such, there is uncertainty in the measurement of
  this outcome as an accepted wage that is relatively low compared to an
  individual's previous wage might be a temporary reality rather than a
  true re-employment wage (i.e., an individual finding stop-gap
  employment).
\item
  \textbf{Outcome variable:} The outcome variable does not adequately
  handle fundamentally different wage scales (i.e., a 10\% wage increase
  would likely be more or less devastating depending on the initial wage
  level). We control for wage levels in various specifications listed
  below. We find that controlling for wage levels does not significantly
  impact our results.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Descriptives}\label{descriptives}

All descriptives below use the Displaced Worker Sample Weights.

Histogram: sample is skewed (see reweighting alternatives at end of
document).

Box plots: Looking at the reported wage ratios in weekly and hourly
values, the mean is fixed near 1 until \textgreater12 mos of
unemployment in hourly wage reporting. In weekly wage reporting, the
``satisficing'' seems to start earlier in unemployment duration (sample
size is larger for weekly reporting - might be worth focusing on those
wages).

Scatter plot: I fit a linear and spline fit to the scatted plot of the
wage ratio to unemployment duration before using the regression.
Indicates decline in the wage ratio with unemployment duration that has
a potentially non-linear fit.

\section{Regressions (non-uniform
sample)}\label{regressions-non-uniform-sample}

Next, before correcting for the non-uniformity of the sample (i.e., that
there are less observations present for higher unemployment durations),
we employ the following econometric specificaitons (with various
modifications to sample and control variables).\textbackslash{}

\(W_{i} = \alpha_{i} + \beta_{1} d_{i} + \beta_{2}UI_{i} + \beta_{3}X_{i} + \epsilon_{i}\)

where \(W_{i}\): Ratio of accepted wage to wage at lost job (hourly
values).

\(d_{i}\): Unemployment duration in continuous (months) or binned
values.

\(UI_{i}\): Control variable for having used or exhausted unemployment
benefits.

\(X_{i}\): Vector of control variables (sex, age, race, marital status,
education level, and previous wage level).

We present and compare 48 variations on the above model present with all
combinations of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Continuous vs.~Discrete Treatment Variable (2 alternatives):}
  Continuous (monthly) versus binned unemployment duration.
\item
  \textbf{w. UI vs w. Exhausted UI (3 alternatives):} The survey
  includes a variable for whether individuals USE and/or EXHAUST
  unemployment benefits. We run the regressions without these UI
  controls, with the control for having used UI, or with the control for
  having exhausted UI.
\item
  \textbf{w. Controls (2 alternatives):} With or without additional
  demographic controls (sex, age, race, married, education).
\item
  \textbf{w. Wage Level (2 alternatives):} With or without wage level of
  lost job to control for income and the relationship between wage
  levels and the outcome wage ratio itself.
\item
  \textbf{Outlier clipped sample (2 alternatives):} Either remove
  outliers where the wage ratio is within {[}0.25, 2.5{]} and reported
  unemployment duration is below 96 weeks (\textasciitilde{} 2 years),
  or employ the raw sample.
\end{itemize}

In each regression table, we include the full set of coefficients to
allow for examination of the regression coefficients on the controls as
well as the principal variables of interest. In each table, we highlight
\(\beta_{1}\) as this is the main regression coefficient of interest. We
employ the \emph{check\_model()} function from the \emph{performance}
package in R to display visual checks of various model assumptions.

Across all models in the tables below we see a consistently negative
coefficient on unemployment duration (\textasciitilde0.7-1 percentage
point increase in the wage ratio for each additional month spent in
unemployment). If we look more closely at the performance of our model
with continuous unemployment duration, UI use (not exhaustion), all
controls, wage levels, and outlier correction we see that the model
performs passably across various diagnostic tests.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{behav_params_overview_files/figure-latex/disc_reg1-1} \end{center}

\subsection{Continuous UE Duration}\label{continuous-ue-duration}

Continuous UE duration treatment is reported in monthly values. A
one-unit increase in the treatment variable = 1 additional month of
unemployment.

\section{Additional Considerations}\label{additional-considerations}

Next, we provide results for the econometric specifications listed above
with better balanced survey samples. We outline the various procedures
employed for dealing with selection issues and non-uniformity in the
sample.

\subsection{Selection Issues with Non-Random
Sample}\label{selection-issues-with-non-random-sample}

One of the challenges with this data is that the sample grows
significantly smaller for higher reported of unemployment duration (see
scatter plots in section above). Therefore, we re-weight our survey
sample (beyond the census weights already employed) to ensure population
similarity across bins. More precisely, we employ propensity score
matching using a generalised linear model, entropy-balancing, and
Heckman selection correction.

Overall, we find the econometric results reported earlier to be
consistent across these implementations, with the coefficients on
unemployment duration remaining somewhat stable.

\subsubsection{Entropy Balancing}\label{entropy-balancing}

First, entropy balancing simply reweights observations to ensure
population matching across the key dependent variable.

Sample}\label{predicted-reservation-wage-using-glm-reweighted-sample}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{behav_params_overview_files/figure-latex/disc_glm3-1} \end{center}

\subsubsection{Heckman Selection}\label{heckman-selection}

Another option is a Heckman Selection correction though I do not think
this addresses the particular selection concern we have where there are
simply less observations in longer unemployment durations.

\subsubsection{Job Tenure}\label{job-tenure}

We have information on the tenure spent at the last job which could
impact the result. This could speak to the ``adaptability'' of
individuals. Wage ratio seems to decrease (although not sure if
meaningfully) with tenure at previous job.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{behav_params_overview_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-1} \end{center}

\subsubsection{Representation}\label{representation}

Although the survey does provide sample weights which we use above, it's
still likely that those who are laid off might be systematically more
susceptible to layoffs (lower-wage, low-skill occupation, male, etc).
Below, some (very rough) graphs to indicate what the sample looks like.

\textbf{Headline result:} it seems the sample over-represents below-mean
wage earners and women. Age looks reasonably accurate (in relation to a
simple median though\ldots.have not checked spread). Have not yet
checked match to educational attainment. Individuals with only a HS
diploma is strong majority in sample - not sure how accurate this is
(likely correlated with wage however\ldots so this might be cause for
concern and confirm a skewed sample in that sense).

If we wish to pursue this data, I could improve on the below but it will
have to do for now.

\section{Supporting Data for
Validation}\label{supporting-data-for-validation}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Intensive Search Effort: Mukoyama et
al.~2018 \emph{Job Search and the Business
Cycle}}{Intensive Search Effort: Mukoyama et al.~2018 Job Search and the Business Cycle}}\label{intensive-search-effort-mukoyama-et-al.-2018-job-search-and-the-business-cycle}

We use evidence from
\href{https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20160202}{Mukoyama
et al.~2018} regarding the cyclicality of unemployed job search effort
to validate the micro behaviour of our agents. This is a foundational
paper within the literature that explores the relationship between
search effort and business cycles. The authors provide new data on the
intensive margin of unemployed search effort (in minutes searched) over
the business cycle by linking date from the American Time Use Survey
(ATUS) and Current Population Survey (CPS). We employ the methods and
data presented in their work in a validation exercise of the emergent
micro behavior of unemployed job-seekers. Note that the figures and code
immediately below are drawn from the replication code provided by the
authors. We have translated the code from Stata to R, but all figures
and regression tables provided rely on the methodology outlined by
Mukoyama et al.~We indicate where we have incorporated new data by
extending the time series to include additional years or applied an
alternative weighting scheme to the data to account for missing data.
The citation for this work can be found in the bibliography of the main
text.

More specifically, the authors provide a novel measure of job search
effort exploiting the American Time Use and Current Population Surveys
which can be reduced to just the intensive margin (changes in search
effort by worker). Typically, this is an extremely challenging measure
to approximate due to data availability and survey design. In general,
surveys measure actions taken (i.e., applications sent, interviews
completed) but these indicators can abstract from the fundamental
intensive margin of search effort. In other words, the most common
metrics that measure search effort can result from passive search or
intrinsic advantageous worker characteristics, obscuring any sense of
real search ``effort'' or urgency with which individuals apply their
search strategies. This intensive margin underlies the motivation behind
our dynamic search effort rule, making this data a valuable source of
validation data for the model's output.

Methodologically, the authors construct this time series measure of job
search intensity by linking the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and
Current Population Survey (CPS). While the ATUS directly measures
minutes spent on job search activities but has limited sample size and
coverage (2003-2014), the CPS reports the number and types of search
methods used over larger samples beginning in 1994. Both surveys ask
similar questions about search methods employed in the previous month.
The authors exploit this overlap by first estimating the relationship
between reported search time and search methods in the ATUS using a
Heckman selection model---estimating both the probability of positive
search time and the number of minutes conditional on searching,
controlling for demographics, occupation, and unemployment duration.
They then apply these estimated coefficients to impute daily search time
for all CPS unemployed respondents based on their reported search
methods, generating a monthly intensive margin series from 1994-2014.
This approach weights each search method by its estimated time intensity
and allows baseline search effort to vary by demographic
characteristics, producing a more nuanced measure than simply counting
the number of methods used.

  et al.~2021: Job Seekers' Perceptions and Employment Prospects:
  Heterogeneity, Duration Dependence and Bias}}
\end{enumerate}

\emph{The authors claim to disentangle the effects of duration
dependence and dynamic selection by using job seekers' elicited beliefs
about job-finding. Assuming (and confirming empirically) that
job-seekers have realistic initial beliefs about job-finding they
isolate the heterogeneity in jobseekers from true duration dependence.
Ultimately, they find that dynamic selection selection explains most of
the negative duration dependence (rather than pure, true duration
dependence).}

\emph{Findings: Results are remarkably consistent even when including
additional data from 2019-2024.} The below results replicate the
findings in Mueller et al and extend the analysis to include a longer
time series. Plot and regression table titles have been maintained for
easy comparison.

We aim to include this information in our theoretical model of the job
search effort as a learning rate (ie. individuals learn about their
re-employment probability with repeated failures in the job search).

\subsection{SCE Job Search Supplement:}\label{sce-job-search-supplement}

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York compiles the nationally
representative Survey on Consumer Expectations annually in October.
Since 2013, they have run a Job Search Supplement which includes
questions on the time spent searching for work, and unemployment
duration. The job search supplement has plenty more questions that we
can look at incorporating, listed
\href{https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Interactives/sce/sce/downloads/data/SCE-Labor-Market-Survey-Data-Codebook.pdf?sc_lang=en}{here}.
For now, I plot the relationship between time spent searching and time
out of work. The table below also indicates the number of people
unemployed in the dataset and the number of people unemployed and
searching.
